## Overview

Friands (Finding Restaurants, Insights And Notably Delectable Spots) is a restaurant analytics and recommendation engine. It leverages advanced Natural Language Processing and Machine Learning techniques to provide meaningful insights about dining establishments.

## Features

- üîç Advanced restaurant search with multi-criteria filtering
- üìä Sentiment analysis of customer reviews
- üó∫Ô∏è Geographic visualization of restaurants
- üìà Analytics dashboards
- ü§ñ Automated review summarization
- üì± Responsive and intuitive UI

## Requirements

Make sure you have :
- [Docker Desktop](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) installed and running,
- [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) installed and executable
- 10GB available disk space to download ML models,
- and a stable internet connection.
